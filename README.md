# Word cloud

This repo is a simple guide about how to create a **word cloud** from a `tex` file

You will find the examples of my **master dissertation** and **PhD thesis** converted into pretty __word clouds__ and the idea is that you can build your own, just changing the `tex` and `stopwords`` files!

## Requirements

This repo is built using the following `python` libraries:
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `PIL`
* `wordcloud`

## Examples

i have been working with **black hole thermodynamics** during my Masters:
